## ScalaMeter team

ScalaMeter was developed by
[Aleksandar Prokopec](http://people.epfl.ch/aleksandar.prokopec)
from the [Scala Team](http://lamp.epfl.ch/) at the [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/),
and [Josh Suereth](http://jsuereth.com/) from [Typesafe](http://typesafe.com/).

The interactive HTML-based performance result visualizations have been designed and
implemented by [Roman Zoller](https://github.com/rzoller).

[Krzysztof Janosz](https://github.com/kjanosz)
is the main person behind the groundbreaking 0.7 release,
and is the person to thank for the new annotation-based Java-compatible frontend,
extending ScalaMeter to arbitrary data-types,
implementing method invocation counting measurers,
backwards-compatible benchmark serialization format,
and much more.

Special thanks goes to [Ngoc Duy Pham](https://github.com/ngocduy-pham)
for doing preliminary research
on the techniques used in ScalaMeter.
